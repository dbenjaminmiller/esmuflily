Esmuflily
=========

Esmuflily is an extension for [LilyPond](http://lilypond.org/) that supports
[SMuFL](http://www.smufl.org/ "Standard Music Font Layout") compliant fonts,
in particular, to facilitate the use of glyphs from
[Ekmelos](https://github.com/tr-igem/ekmelos) :
clefs, time signatures, noteheads, articulations, etc.

Esmuflily provides switches to turn the SMuFL support on or off for individual
types of graphical objects (clefs, noteheads, etc.) and it defines
additional commands and styles for SMuFL glyphs which are not available
in LilyPond (notehead styles, function theory symbols, etc.)
So scores can benefit from both SMuFL's comprehensive character set
and LilyPond's awesome Emmentaler font.

Esmuflily requires LilyPond version 2.24.0 or higher.
